### ðŸ”¹Auto Scaling with Application Load Balancer (ALB) Using Launch Template

**Auto Scaling** and **ALB** are used together in AWS to automatically manage traffic and ensure availability of EC2 instances. A **Launch Template** defines how new instances should be created when scaling.

---

### âœ… Key Components

1. **Launch Template**

   * Defines instance configuration (AMI, instance type, key pair, user data, etc.)
   * Reusable when launching EC2 instances in Auto Scaling Groups.

2. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**

   * Distributes incoming traffic across healthy EC2 instances.
   * Works at the **application layer (Layer 7)** and supports path-based routing.

3. **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**

   * Automatically adds/removes EC2 instances based on demand.
   * Uses the Launch Template to create new instances.
   * Registers instances with the ALB target group.

---

### ðŸ”§ Workflow Overview

1. **Create Launch Template**

   * Includes AMI ID, instance type, and security group.
   * Optionally includes user data (e.g., install a web server).

2. **Create Target Group**

   * ALB uses this group to register and route traffic to EC2 instances.
   * Health checks are configured here.

3. **Create Application Load Balancer**

   * Attach listeners (e.g., HTTP on port 80).
   * Forward traffic to the target group.

4. **Create Auto Scaling Group**

   * Attach the launch template and ALB target group.
   * Set minimum, maximum, and desired capacity.
   * Add scaling policies (e.g., based on CPU usage).

---

### ðŸ“ˆ Example Scenario

* Launch template installs a web app.
* ALB distributes traffic to EC2s in multiple AZs.
* Auto Scaling adds instances during high traffic and removes them during low traffic.

---

### âœ… Benefits

* **High availability**: Traffic is balanced across instances.
* **Fault tolerance**: Unhealthy instances are automatically replaced.
* **Cost-efficient**: Resources scale with demand.
* **Resilience**: Works across multiple Availability Zones.


## Project on Auto Scaling with ALB
1. Firstly go to the EC2 dashboard and then go to Launch Template
![caption](/img/1.ec2-dashboard.jpg)

2. then create Launch template 
![caption](/img/2.create-launch-template.jpg)

3. Creating Launch template by selecting the AMI
![caption](/img/3.create-launch-interface.jpg)

4. select the instance type

5. you can add a user data

6. A successfkul launch instance will display

7. After we move to auto-scaling group, then create auto scale

8. Name the group and select your created launch template

9. Move to network section. Select your vpc and also availability zones

10. You can created a new load balancer if there's none existing b4

11. Then save ur auto scale group

This will create a running instance on ec2 instance
